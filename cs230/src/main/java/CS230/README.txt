How to run and compile the program:

1. Click through to \cs230\src\main\java\CS230
2. Click on the Main.java class
3. It is suggested to open the above using InteliJ as we are using Maven Dependencies which auto-install upon first opening of the file on your computer
4. Click on the green button at the top right of InteliJ to start building and compiling the program
5. It may take a while on first compile for it to load, this is normal as it's sorting out the Maven dependencies
6. The game will now be ready to play!
