How to run and compile the program:

1. Open CS230 directory, suggested to open using InteliJ
as we are using Maven Dependencies which auto-install upon first opening of the file on your computer
2. Click on the Main.java class
3. Click on the green button at the top right of InteliJ to start building and compiling the program
4. It may take a while on first compile for it to load, this is normal as it's sorting out the Maven dependencies
5. The game will now be ready to play!
